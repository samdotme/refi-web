### Front End

To get started developing on the front end, cd into `front-end` and run these commands:

    npm install

    npm run build:watch

This will put your terminal into a watch state so that any Typescript changes will be re-compiled automatically.

To see the app running in a browser, you will need to have Golang installed.

Once installed, from the project root directory, run `go run main.go` and then open `http://localhost:8080`.
